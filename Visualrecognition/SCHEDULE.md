### Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 9am - noon
During this time you should watch the video lectures and then study the reading material. It should be easier to follow and understand the reading material after watching the video lectures. 

### Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 1pm - 4pm
During this time you should continue going through the reading material. When you are done, you can start going through the test for that particular lecture. 

### Monday - Friday: 5pm - 8pm
I will hold a live Q&A session to answer any question regarding the video lectures and the reading material. After that, I will walk you through the practical session and explain what is expected from you. 

### Deadlines
* The deadlines for the tests are shown in the schedule. The dropbox link will close at that time and you won't be able to upload your answers after that. No uploaded answers means `0/100`! Each question in the test has equal weight, in other words each question counts for `100/#qs` where `#qs` is the number of questions in the test. 

* The deadline for the lab sessions is on Sunday May 3rd, by end of day (Rwanda' time). However, I advise you to start early so that you have the chance to ask questions in our Q&A sessions during the week and also get assistance from the TAs. The dropblox link for the labs will be deactivated after Sunday, midnight (Rwanda's time). No uploaded reports means `0/100`! Reports will be graded with maximum score of `100`.

### Grades
Your final grade will be determined as follows: 
```
final_grade = 0.25 * (grade_test1 + grade_test2 + grade_test3) / 3 + 0.75 * (grade_lab1 + grade_lab2 + grade_lab3)
```
